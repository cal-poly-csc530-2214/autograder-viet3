# Setting up Sketch
Thanks to Joe's advice on Piazza, I was able to download the working tarball
and Sketch runs flawlessly.

# Reading
I read the autograder paper but when I got to Sketch I started going down that
rabbit hole instead. I initially tried to look at the journal paper on Sketch
https://people.csail.mit.edu/asolar/papers/Solar-Lezama09.pdf, but the author's
lecture https://people.csail.mit.edu/asolar/SynthesisCourse/Lecture7.htm was
much more digestible. Coincidentally this is what I ran into when trying to
learn about VSA as well (caution: the lecture notes have a lot of typos/errors
that confuse me a lot until I convinced myself that they were errors).

# Experiment
I tried to run Sketch with the bit vector reversing example from the lecture
but Sketch couldn't solve it ... A little dissapointing as the author said it
worked. More to come ...
